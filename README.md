# MAP-IR-Lab1

Welcome to the *Metode avansate de programare* course! Make sure to follow the rules, ensure you have access to Microsoft Teams and don't forget to push your work using the repository's structure:

- `Lab1.mdj`, a file updated with [StarUML](https://staruml.io/), containing the UML class diagram;
- `java`, a folder containing the Java implementation of the laboratory requirements.

Please check Microsoft Teams for details on the laboratory requirements.
